<span style="font-size:0.87em;">  
**Course**: AI in Precision Medicine: Graphs, Images, and Omics (Planned)   
**Target audience**: Graduate students in Computer Science, Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology.    
– Module 1: Introduction to Spatial Biology       
Overview of cellular biology and tumor ecosystem; histopathology images; spatial biology technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics.               
– Module 2: Classical Machine Learning for Biomedicine       
K-means clustering, graph clustering (Leiden, Spectral Clustering), spatial statistics, and foundational techniques for analyzing high-dimensional biological and omics data.      
– Module 3: Foundations of Graph and Deep Learning             
Key concepts in graph neural networks, contrastive learning, and vision transformers in biomedical contexts.        
– Module 4: Multimodal Data Integration      
Foundation models in digital pathology; integration of omics, imaging, and clinical records; methods for cross-modal representation learning and alignment; guided paper discussions.        
– Module 5: Software Tools and Platforms                  
Hands-on tutorials with tools like Scanpy, Squidpy, PyTorch Geometric, SCIMAP, and SpatialCells; emphasis on practical coding and data analysis workflows.
