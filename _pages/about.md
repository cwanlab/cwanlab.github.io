<!-- I am a Computer Scientist and an Instructor at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, working with the Semenov group.
Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2021, 
where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Haim Schweitzer.</span>

<!-- Our research focuses on the development of computational methodologies for multimodal analyses and explainable machine learning models of biomedical data, which will enable personalized medicine. -->
<span style="font-size:0.78em;">
At CWan Lab (pronounced "Wan Lab"), we advance the foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning to address key challenges in biomedicine, with a focus on spatially resolved biological data. Our work bridges algorithmic innovation and real-world application, developing biologically grounded and clinically impactful models that uncover disease mechanisms and drive personalized medicine.
