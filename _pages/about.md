<span style="font-size:0.92em;">
I am a Computer Scientist and an Instructor at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, working with the Semenov group.
Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by Haim Schweitzer.           

My research focuses on the development of computational methodologies for multimodal analyses and explainable machine learning models of biomedical data, which will enable personalized medicine.
