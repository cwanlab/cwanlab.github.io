<span style="font-size:0.87em;">
I am a Computer Scientist and an Instructor at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, working with the Semenov group.
Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2021, 
where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Haim Schweitzer.</span>           

<span style="font-size:0.87em;">
My research focuses on the development of computational methodologies for multimodal analyses and explainable machine learning models of biomedical data, which will enable personalized medicine.</span>
